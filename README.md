# RNVideo-Player-

This video player app has a control bar in which the user can mute and play/pause the video from the current screen.

## Setup

1. Use your terminal to navigate to a specific folder's directory and `git clone` the url.
2. In terminal run `npm install` in order to install the necessary packages found in the `package.json` file to run this simulator.
3. Since I was using an iOS simulator, I ran `expo start` and pressed `i` for iOS simulator. You can use an android simulator too or scan the QR code on the metro bundler to open it up on your physical device as well.
4. Give it some time to for metro bundler to build the bundle and the app should open up.

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è
[React-Native](https://docs.expo.dev/) on the Expo framework
